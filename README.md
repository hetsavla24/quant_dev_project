# Strategy Backtest Project

Author: Het Savla

## Project Overview

This project implements a trading strategy backtest using spot data and options data for calendar year 2023.  
It combines in-house signals with popular technical indicators to create composite signals used in an ML model to generate trade signals.  
The strategy involves selling ATM options based on buy/sell signals with defined stop-loss, take-profit, and forced exit rules.

## Usage Examples

1. **Run Model Training**

python model.py

2. **Run Backtest**

python backtest.py

text

3. **Generate Plots**

Plotting functions are included in utils.py and called automatically during backtest.

## Indicators and Model Details

- Indicators used include MACD, RSI, ADX, SuperTrend, Bollinger Bands, EMA crossover, Stochastic, ATR.
- Composite signals are generated by combining indicator signals with custom weights.
- ML models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) are trained and evaluated with time-based train/test split.
- The best model is selected based on accuracy and classification metrics.

## Backtest Parameters

- Starting capital: ₹200,000
- Stop-loss: 1.5%
- Take-profit: 3% or close at end of day
- Forced exit time: 15:15 local
- Margin interest, transaction costs, and slippage ignored

---

## Results Interpretation

- The equity curve shows portfolio value over time.
- The drawdown plot indicates maximum peak-to-trough losses.
- Metrics CSV provides key performance indicators.
- Trades CSV details individual trade entries and exits.
